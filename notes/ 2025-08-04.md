## Linux Folder Structure

**Key directories and what they do:**

| Folder     | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/`        | Root of the entire filesystem               |
| `/home`    | Contains personal directories for users     |
| `/etc`     | Configuration files (e.g. `/etc/passwd`)    |
| `/bin`     | Essential binary programs (`ls`, `cp`, etc) |
| `/usr`     | User-installed apps and utilities           |
| `/var`     | Logs, temporary files, etc.                 |
| `/tmp`     | Temporary files, wiped after reboot         |
| `/root`    | Home directory for the root user            |

**Practice Commands:**
```bash
ls /
cd /etc
tree / -L 1       # View structure one level deep
ðŸ‘¤ Linux User & Group Management
ðŸ”¹ Create a New User
```bash

sudo adduser student1
ðŸ”¹ Modify an Existing User
```bash

sudo usermod -aG sudo student1        # Add to sudo group
sudo usermod -l newname student1      # Rename user
ðŸ”¹ Create and Assign Group

```bash
sudo groupadd devops
sudo usermod -aG devs student1        # Add user to group
ðŸ”¹ View Users and Groups
```bash
cat /etc/passwd         # List all users
cat /etc/group          # List all groups
groups student1         # See groups for student1
ðŸ”¹ Password Management
```bash
sudo passwd student1     # Set or change user password
sudo passwd -l student1  # Lock user account

Practical Linux Command Practice

```bash
ls -la                # List all files (including hidden)
pwd                   # Show current directory
cd /etc               # Move to /etc
mkdir testfolder      # Create a directory
rm -r testfolder      # Delete a directory
touch file.txt        # Create a file
nano file.txt         # Edit file using nano
cat file.txt          # Display file contents

SSH â€” Secure Shell
What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure terminal access to a remote computer.

ðŸ”¸ Basic SSH Usage
```bash
ssh username@ip_address
Example:

```bash
ssh biola@192.168.1.114
ðŸ”¸ Common Issues & Fixes
Connection Refused
âž¤ Cause: SSH server not installed or not running
âž¤ Fix:
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl start ssh
Permission Denied
âž¤ Cause: Wrong username or password

 Host Key Not Found
âž¤ Fix: First-time connection â€” type yes to proceed

Useful Extras
```bash
hostname -I     # Show IP address
whoami          # Show current user
exit            # Exit remote session
