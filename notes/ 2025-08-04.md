## Linux Folder Structure

**Key directories and what they do:**

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Root of the entire filesystem |
| `/home` | Contains personal directories for users |
| `/etc` | Configuration files (e.g. `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hostname`) |
| `/bin` | Essential binary programs (`ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/usr` | User-installed apps and utilities |
| `/var` | Logs, temporary files, etc. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files, wiped after reboot |
| `/root` | Home directory for the root user |

**Practice commands:**

```bash
ls /
cd /etc
tree / -L 1       # View structure one level deep

Linux User & Group Management
ðŸ”¹ Create a New User

```
sudo adduser student1


```bash
ðŸ”¹ Modify User

```
sudo usermod -aG sudo student1    # Add to sudo group
sudo usermod -l newname student1  # Rename user


```bash
ðŸ”¹ Create Group

```
sudo groupadd devs
sudo usermod -aG devs student1    # Add user to group

```bash
ðŸ”¹ View Users and Groups

```
cat /etc/passwd        # List all users
cat /etc/group         # List all groups
groups student1        # See which groups a user belongs to

```bash

```
Password Management

sudo passwd student1   # Set or change password
sudo passwd -l student1  # Lock user account

```bash

Practical Linux Command Practice
Commands I practiced:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -la                # List all files, including hidden ones
pwd                   # Print current working directory
cd /etc               # Navigate into /etc
mkdir testfolder      # Create directory
rm -r testfolder      # Remove directory
touch file.txt        # Create file
nano file.txt         # Edit file using nano
cat file.txt          # Display file contents


SSH â€” Secure Shell 
What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) lets you securely connect to another computer over the network using the terminal.

Basic SSH Usage

```
ssh username@ip_address

```bash
Example:

```
ssh biola@192.168.1.114

```bash
Issues & Fixes
Connection refused: SSH server not installed or not running on target machine.

Fix:

```
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl start ssh

```bash
Permission denied: wrong user or password.

Host key not found: first-time connection â€” type yes.

Useful Extras

```
hostname -I     # Show IP addresses
whoami          # Show current user
exit            # Exit remote session

```bash
