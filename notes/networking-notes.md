# Networking Notes

## Summary

This section focuses on fundamental networking commands in Linux, used for checking connectivity, interface configuration, and monitoring network activity.

## Topics Covered

- Viewing and configuring IP addresses
- Testing connectivity (ping, traceroute)
- Viewing open ports and connections
- DNS resolution
- Network interface management

---

## What I Learned Today

- How to view network interfaces using `ip a` instead of the deprecated `ifconfig`.
- How to test network connectivity using `ping`, `traceroute`, and check DNS using `nslookup`.
- Monitor open connections and listening ports using `netstat -tulnp` and `ss -tulnp`.

## Improvements

- I now understand how to inspect IP configurations and test external/internal connectivity.
- Learnt multiple alternatives to older tools like `ifconfig → ip`, `netstat → ss`.
